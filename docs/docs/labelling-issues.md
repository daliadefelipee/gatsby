## What are issue labels?

Issue labels are a tool in GitHub that that is used to group issues into one or more categories.

[Check out Gatsby's labels (and their descriptions)](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/labels)


## Why label issues?

Gatsby is a very active project with many new issues opened each day. Labelling issues helps by identifying:

- good issues for new contributors to work on
- reported and confirmed bugs
- new features
- duplicate issues
- issues that are stalled or blocked

## How to label an issue

Ideally every issue should have a single `🏷 type:` label applied to it. Optionally a `status: ` label, and one or more other labels may also be applied.

Before continuing, get familiar with [Gatsby's issue labels and their descriptions](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/labels).


### Find an issue that you're interested in

Start with [Gatsby's issues list](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues) and scroll through until you see one that strikes your interest.

### Read the issue

Read the issue and any comments

### Choose one `type: ` label

Check through the [`type: ` labels (and their descriptions)](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/labels) and choose the one that best applies to the issue.

The most common type of issue is `type: question or discussion`, typically you can apply this to issues that are open-ended or have no clear next step.

It's OK to change the type of an issue as more information becomes available. What starts as `type: question or discussion`, might later need to be changed to `type: bug`.

Changing labels is quick and easily reversible, so don't worry too much about applying a "wrong" label.

### Choose a `status: ` label (optional)

Check through the [`📍 status: ` labels (and their descriptions)](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/labels), if any apply to this issue add them as necessary.

Examples of applying `📍 status: ` labels might be:

- An issue that depends on an external dependency being changed could be labelled with `📍 status: blocked`

- An issue with a clear description of how it can be resolved could be labelled `📍 status: help wanted`.

- An issue that's missing information required to help the author could be labelled with `📍 status: needs more info`

- An issue describing a bug without clear steps to reproduce could be labelled with `📍 status: needs reproduction`

- An issue describing a bug where there's steps to reproduce the bug _and_ you (or someone else) have confirmed that they can reproduce the bug can be labelled `📍 status: confirmed`

### TODO - is there a way to publicly list these people?  https://github.com/orgs/gatsbyjs/teams/admin/members
- An issue describing a feature can be labelled `📍 status: confirmed` if a member of Gatsby's Admin team has approved the feature

### Choose any other labels

There are a few other labels that can sometimes be applied to an issue. Here are some more examples of when to use them:

- `good first issue` can be used when an issue is a small, clearly defined piece of work that could be completed by someone without in-depth knowledge of Gatsby and how it works. These issues are particularly suitable for people making their first open source contributions.

- `stale?` can be used on an issue where the author has not replied to requests for further information in at least 20 days.
